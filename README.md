# Coding-Review-Quiz

## Description

Coding Review Quiz is an application that allows users to test their coding knowledge. The quiz consists of five multiple choice questions. Once the user presses "Start Quiz", they have 75 seconds to answer the questions. If they answer incorrectly, they are penalized by 10 seconds. Once they reach the end of the quiz, the time they have remaining is recorded as their score. They can then save the score with their initials to the scoreboard for other users to see. Then, they can either return to the home page to start the quiz over or clear the high score board.
